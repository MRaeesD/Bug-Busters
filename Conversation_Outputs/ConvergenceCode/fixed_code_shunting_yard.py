### Explanation of Fixes

1. **Pushing the Current Operator:**
   - After the `while` loop that pops operators with higher or equal precedence, we now push the current operator onto the stack. This ensures that the current operator is not lost and is correctly placed in the stack.

2. **Handling Parentheses:**
   - When encountering an opening parenthesis `'('`, it is pushed onto the stack.
   - When encountering a closing parenthesis `')'`, operators are popped from the stack and added to the output until an opening parenthesis `'('` is encountered. The opening parenthesis is then popped from the stack and discarded.
   - This ensures that the parentheses are correctly handled, and the precedence of operations is maintained.
