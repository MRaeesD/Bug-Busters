Emojis: find in sorted
	minimum spanning tree

SEED=42
***Find in sorted(6) - missing -emojis
***knapsack(13) - APR_debugger_1 gave a test case, and the judge said GOOD instead of GOOD_REPAIR. knapsack(AttributeError: module 'pytest' has no attribute 'run_slow')
***minimum spanning tree(21) - missing - emojis
***sqrt(36) - missing - judge_1 produces invalid content

**shunting yard - Judge_2 said DONE_REPAIRING instead of GOOD_REPAIR. going back to the code that should have been marked as "GOOD_REPAIR", all tests pass.
**to_base - no full code block - reporting_agent did not give full code block even though it was there. Going back to the last full code block, all tests pass.

is_valid_paranthesization - has additional comments before code

SEED=43
find in sorted - judge_2 did not give a score. Judge turns into a party to the APR conversation. Taking first final APR response before judge speaks: All tests pass
knapsack - judge_2 said GOOD instead of GOOD_REPAIR. knapsack(AttributeError: module 'pytest' has no attribute 'run_slow')
***minimum_spanning_tree - emojis again
sqrt - Reporting agent didn't provide full code block. Taking last full code block: All test cases pass.


SEED=44
minimum spanning tree - Worked
