hanoi


An algorithm for solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.  Three pegs exist, with a stack of differently-sized
disks beginning on one peg, ordered from smallest on top to largest on bottom.  The goal is to move the
entire stack to a different peg via a series of steps.  Each step must move a single disk from one peg to
another. At no point may a disk be placed on top of another smaller disk.

Input:
height: The height of the initial stack of disks.
start: The numbered peg where the initial stack resides.
end: The numbered peg which the stack must be moved onto.

Preconditions:
height >= 0
start in (1, 2, 3)
end in (1, 2, 3)

Output:
An ordered list of pairs (a, b) representing the shortest series of steps (each step moving
the top disk from peg a to peg b) that solves the puzzle.

The code is expected to function as follows:
Wrap Text

Given a long string and a column width, break the string on spaces into a list of lines such that each line is no longer than the column width.

Input:
text: The starting text.
cols: The target column width, i.e. the maximum length of any single line after wrapping.

Precondition:
cols > 0.

Output:
An ordered list of strings, each no longer than the column width, such that the concatenation of the strings returns the original text,
and such that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless necessary.  The original amount of spaces are preserved (e.g. spaces
at the start or end of each line aren't trimmed.),Wrapping Text
