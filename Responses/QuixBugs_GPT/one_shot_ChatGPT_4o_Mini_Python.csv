An algorithm for solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.  Three pegs exist, with a stack of differently-sized
disks beginning on one peg, ordered from smallest on top to largest on bottom.  The goal is to move the

another. At no point may a disk be placed on top of another smaller disk.

Code Context:

Wrap Text

Given a long string and a column width, break the string on spaces into a list of lines such that each line is no longer than the column width.

Input:
text: The starting text.
cols: The target column width, i.e. the maximum length of any single line after wrapping.

Precondition:
cols > 0.

Output:
An ordered list of strings, each no longer than the column width, such that the concatenation of the strings returns the original text,
and such that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless necessary.  The original amount of spaces are preserved (e.g. spaces
at the start or end of each line aren't trimmed.),Wrapping Text


Code:
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:]
        lines.append(line)

    return lines
","Line Number: 8

Line of Code: line, text = text[:end], text[end:]

Reason: The bug occurs because the value of `text` is being reassigned to an empty string once the entire original text is processed and no remaining words fit within the column width, which can lead to an infinite loop if `len(text)` remains greater than `cols` but `text` itself has been exhausted.",309,85,8,"line, text = text[:end], text[end:]","The bug occurs because the value of `text` is being reassigned to an empty string once the entire original text is processed and no remaining words fit within the column width, which can lead to an infinite loop if `len(text)` remains greater than `cols` but `text` itself has been exhausted.",A line is omitted before the return statement.,FALSE
