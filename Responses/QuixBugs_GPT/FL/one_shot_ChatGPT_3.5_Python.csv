An algorithm for solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.  Three pegs exist, with a stack of differently-sized
disks beginning on one peg, ordered from smallest on top to largest on bottom.  The goal is to move the
entire stack to a different peg via a series of steps.  Each step must move a single disk from one peg to
another. At no point may a disk be placed on top of another smaller disk.

Input:
height: The height of the initial stack of disks.
start: The numbered peg where the initial stack resides.
end: The numbered peg which the stack must be moved onto.

Preconditions:

An ordered list of pairs (a, b) representing the shortest series of steps (each step moving
the top disk from peg a to peg b) that solves the puzzle.

Calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings.  The Levenshtein distance is defined as the minimum amount of single-character edits (either removing a character, adding a character, or changing a character) necessary to transform a source string into a target string.
