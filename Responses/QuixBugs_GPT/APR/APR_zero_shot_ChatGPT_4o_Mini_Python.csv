However, it does not address the issue of `n` being modified in a loop which causes it to eventually evaluate to zero and exit the loop. Since there is no bug in the bit counting algorithm itself for the given logic, it is essential to ensure that `n` is not inadvertently modified to a state that causes premature termination.

Fix: 
```python
def bitcount(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        n &= (n - 1)  # Changed from ^= to &= to ensure that only the last set bit is turned off
        count += 1
