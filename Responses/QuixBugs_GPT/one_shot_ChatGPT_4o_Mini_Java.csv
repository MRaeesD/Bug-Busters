Towers of Hanoi
hanoi


An algorithm for solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.  Three pegs exist, with a stack of differently-sized
disks beginning on one peg, ordered from smallest on top to largest on bottom.  The goal is to move the
entire stack to a different peg via a series of steps.  Each step must move a single disk from one peg to
another. At no point may a disk be placed on top of another smaller disk.

Input:
height: The height of the initial stack of disks.
start: The numbered peg where the initial stack resides.
end: The numbered peg which the stack must be moved onto.

Preconditions:
height >= 0
start in (1, 2, 3)

An ordered list of pairs (a, b) representing the shortest series of steps (each step moving
the top disk from peg a to peg b) that solves the puzzle.

K-Heapsort
k-heapsort

Sorts an almost-sorted array, wherein every element is no more than k units from its sorted position, in O(n log k) time.

Input:
arr: A list of ints
k: an int indicating the maximum displacement of an element in arr from its final sorted location

Preconditions:

Each element in arr is at most k places from its sorted position.

Output:

knapsack

You have a knapsack that can hold a maximum weight. You are given a selection of items, each with a weight and a value. You may

Minimum-Weight Paths
bellman-ford

Bellman-Ford algorithm implementation

Given a directed graph that may contain negative edges (as long as there are no negative-weight cycles), efficiently calculates the minimum path weights from a source node to every other node in the graph.

Input:
source: A node id
weight_by_edge: A dict containing edge weights keyed by an ordered pair of node ids

Precondition:
The input graph contains no negative-weight cycles

Output:
A dict mapping each node id to the minimum weight of a path from the source node to that node

Example:
>>> shortest_paths('A', {
('A', 'B'): 3,
('A', 'C'): 3,
('A', 'F'): 5,
('C', 'B'): -2,
('C', 'D'): 7,

Integer Base Conversion

Input:
num: A base-10 integer to convert.
b: The target base to convert it to.

Precondition:
num > 0, 2 <= b <= 36.

Output:
A string representing the value of num in base b.

Example:
>>> to_base(31, 16)

Wrap Text

Given a long string and a column width, break the string on spaces into a list of lines such that each line is no longer than the column width.

Input:
text: The starting text.
cols: The target column width, i.e. the maximum length of any single line after wrapping.

Precondition:
cols > 0.

Output:
An ordered list of strings, each no longer than the column width, such that the concatenation of the strings returns the original text,
and such that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless necessary.  The original amount of spaces are preserved (e.g. spaces
at the start or end of each line aren't trimmed.),Wrapping Text
