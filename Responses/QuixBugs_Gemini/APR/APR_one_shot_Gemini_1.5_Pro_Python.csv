hanoi


An algorithm for solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.  Three pegs exist, with a stack of differently-sized
disks beginning on one peg, ordered from smallest on top to largest on bottom.  The goal is to move the
entire stack to a different peg via a series of steps.  Each step must move a single disk from one peg to
another. At no point may a disk be placed on top of another smaller disk.

Input:
height: The height of the initial stack of disks.
start: The numbered peg where the initial stack resides.
end: The numbered peg which the stack must be moved onto.

Preconditions:
height >= 0
start in (1, 2, 3)
end in (1, 2, 3)

Output:
An ordered list of pairs (a, b) representing the shortest series of steps (each step moving
the top disk from peg a to peg b) that solves the puzzle.

The current implementation moves the disk directly from the `start` peg to the `helper` peg. This is incorrect as it violates the rules of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. We need to move the largest disk (bottom disk) from the `start` peg to the `end` peg.

Calculates the length of the shortest path connecting every ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph.

The current implementation incorrectly calculates the shortest path length by adding `length_by_path[j, k]`, instead of `length_by_path[k, j]`, to `length_by_path[i, k]`. This results in an incorrect computation of the path length, as it doesn't reflect the actual path from node `k` to node `j`.
