2. **`return flatten(arr)`:** This line was causing infinite recursion as the `flatten(arr)` call would just call itself repeatedly without any base case. 

To fix these issues, we need to treat non-list elements as individual elements and only recursively flatten when `x` is a list.




package java_programs;
import java.util.*;

public class FLATTEN {
    public static Object flatten(Object arr) {
        if (arr instanceof ArrayList) {
            ArrayList narr = (ArrayList) arr;
            ArrayList result = new ArrayList(50);
            for (Object x : narr) {
                if (x instanceof ArrayList) {
                    result.addAll((ArrayList) flatten(x));
                } else {
                    result.add(x); // Change: Add 'x' directly to the list instead of flattening it.
                }
            }
            return result;
        } else {
            return arr; // Change: Return the element itself if it is not a list.
        }
    }
}
