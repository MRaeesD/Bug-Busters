Reason: The `return []` statement is not correct in the base case when `k` is 0. It should return an empty list of subsequences in this case.

Fix:

def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        # Change here
        return [[]]

    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b + 1 - k):
        ret.extend(
            [i] + rest for rest in subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)
        )

    return ret
