The line `get(unvisited_nodes, nextnode) + length_by_edge[node, nextnode]` has a bug because it tries to add the distance from `node` to `nextnode` to the existing distance of `nextnode` in the priority queue even when `get(unvisited_nodes, nextnode)` returns 0. This is incorrect as 0 is returned when the node is not present in the heap, and adding anything to it will lead to incorrect distance calculations. Instead, we should only add the edge length to the existing distance if it exists (i.e., `get(unvisited_nodes, nextnode)` returns a non-zero value).
