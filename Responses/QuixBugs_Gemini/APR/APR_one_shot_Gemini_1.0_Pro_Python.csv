another. At no point may a disk be placed on top of another smaller disk.

Minimum-Weight Paths
bellman-ford

Bellman-Ford algorithm implementation

Given a directed graph that may contain negative edges (as long as there are no negative-weight cycles), efficiently calculates the minimum path weights from a source node to every other node in the graph.

Input:
source: A node id
weight_by_edge: A dict containing edge weights keyed by an ordered pair of node ids

Precondition:
The input graph contains no negative-weight cycles

Output:
A dict mapping each node id to the minimum weight of a path from the source node to that node

Example:

('A', 'B'): 3,
('A', 'C'): 3,
('A', 'F'): 5,
('C', 'B'): -2,

result = alphabet[i] + result

    return lines

The code is expected to function as follows: 
Wrap Text

Given a long string and a column width, break the string on spaces into a list of lines such that each line is no longer than the column width.

Input:
text: The starting text.
cols: The target column width, i.e. the maximum length of any single line after wrapping.

Precondition:
cols > 0.

Output:
An ordered list of strings, each no longer than the column width, such that the concatenation of the strings returns the original text,
and such that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless necessary.  The original amount of spaces are preserved (e.g. spaces
at the start or end of each line aren't trimmed.),Wrapping Text
